# SATMO and the Mexican's ocean monitoring and analysis system

## Mexican marine ecosystems information and analysis system, general overview

SATMO is the satellite component of a complete marine monitoring and analysis system (*sistema de información y análisis de ecosistemas marino-costeros de México*). Another important component of the system will be the in-situ monitoring component. The in-situ system will ingest, analyze, and use both near real and a non-real time data (from buoys, stations, existing networks, university researchers, and crowd-sourcing). The data generated by the in-situ component of the system will play an important role in:

- Validation of SATMO outputs
- Analysis aimed at answering research questions
- Generation of alerts

The overall system can be summarized with the conceptual diagram below.

Therefore *SATMO should be a point where analysis ready data from various satellite sources is available, facilitating efficient analysis with well integrated and up to date datasets.*

Direct applications of the overall system will be:

- Alert, forecast and early warning system for issues such as

	- Sargassum blooms (Detect and forecast future locations according to ocean currents)
	- Algae blooms (Including rapid alert to inform sanitary authorities that can subsequently test for toxicity)
	- Risks of coral bleaching

- Facilitated centralized access to various kind of data and information about seas and oceans


These activities should result in:

- An improved knowledge and understanding of marine ecosystems and dynamics
- A better capacity to monitor, protect, and manage marine ecosystems


## SATMO details

SATMO roles are to:

- Provide facilitated access to up to date information on various ocean parameters measurable by satellite

This implies that SATMO must

- Download relevant archived and upcoming satellite data in an operational manner
- Gather auxiliary products for required for analysis and forecasting (e.g. Ocean currents)
- Compute ecologically relevant variables
- Produce and update information required to compute anomalies

## Detailed description of the ingestion and processing steps

### Data sources

This is a description of the fully automated ingestion and processing module of the SATMO. The main source of raw data is the ocean color [DAAC](http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Processing from L0 to L1A is completely standard and performed automatically and in near real time by the ocean color system. L1A products are therefore preferred over L0 as they maintain all data characteristics and are suitable for re-calibrations, while limiting storage and processing requirements. Alternatively data can be obtained directly from the CONABIO antenna, as it receives, directly from various sensors, Production datasets (PDS). This option however, requires further data processing and is considered secondary at the moment and would only be used in case of dysfunction of the ocean color DAAC or in case of US government shutdown.


### Data processing

Processing is done automatically, triggered by the availability of the required data on the ocean color DAAC, with a flexible and modular design that combines existing tools with custom made solutions. The main pre-processing steps (e.g. generation of L2 surface reflectance data) are supported by the (already existing) SeaDAS processing modules, while later steps of the processing chain are implemented in python.
This flexible design enables the implementation of new algorithms in a timely manner as well as the capacity to accommodate new sensors.

The (daily, weekly and monthly) composites calculated are required to compute and update climatologies for each variables, from which anomalies can be generated.
