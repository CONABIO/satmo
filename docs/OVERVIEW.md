# SATMO and the Mexican's ocean monitoring and analysis system

SATMO is the satellite component of a complete marine monitoring and analysis system (*sistema de información y análisis de ecosistemas marino-costeros de México*). Another important component of the system will be the in-situ monitoring component. The in-situ system will ingest, analyse, and use both near real and a non-real time data (from buoys, stations, existing networks, university researchers, and crowdsourcing). The data generated by the in-situ component of the system will play an important role in:
- Validation of SATMO outputs
- Analysis aimed at answering research questions
- Generation of alerts

The overall system can be summarized with the conceptual diagram below.

*SATMO should be a point where analysis ready data from various satellite sources is available, facilitating efficient analysis with well integrated and up to date datasets.*

Direct output of the system will be:
- Alert system for Sargassum, Algeae blooms and coral bleaching
- Forcast and early warning system


These activities should result in:
- Improved knowledge and understanding of marine ecosystems and dynamics
- Better capacity to monitor, protect, and manage marine ecosystems
