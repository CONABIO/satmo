# This document provides a brief overview of the products generated by and stored on the system

## Spatial considerations

Similarly to the previous version of the system, the area covered stretches from South to North between 3 and 33 degrees and from West to East between -122 and -72 degrees.

The number of pixels covering the areas for the various spatial resolutions (250, 500 and 1000 m) will depend on the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) chosen for the output.

An equal area projection (laea, aea) centered in the 


## Intermediary Vs Final

Final products are defined by biophysical variables whose values have a direct biological/ecological/analytical interest (Chlorophyll-alpha, Sea Surface Temperature, etc). On the contrary, intermediary products do not represent any direct biologically meaningful biophysical variable (reflectance, ). These would for instance not be displayed/displayable on the web visualization platform.


## Rolling Vs permanent archiving

Even though they constitute final products, certain variables do not need to be stored permanently on the system, and can be replaced by new incoming data, hence saving storage.
This is for instance the case of near real time products, which have an immediate relevance but become obsolete after consolidation.

- Intermediary products:

Intermediary products are mostly surface reflectance layers, used for the computation of above products.

### Anomalies



### Annex products

Bathymetry, coast lines, administrative borders


## Data sources

- MODIS Terra
- MODIS Aqua
- VIIRS
- SeaWIFS

## Cross sensor composite products

Sounds silly to me to keep sensors separated rather than building unified variables from the various data sources!
What are the options?
