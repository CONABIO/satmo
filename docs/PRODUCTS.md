# This document provides a brief overview of the products generated by and stored on the system

## Spatial considerations

Similarly to the previous version of the system, the area covered stretches from South to North between 3 and 33 degrees and from West to East between -122 and -72 degrees.

The number of pixels covering the areas for the various spatial resolutions (250, 500 and 1000 m) will depend on the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) chosen for the output (2880x4800 at 1km resolution with a plate caree CRS)

Plate caree appears to be the standard projection of the ocean color community. This remains an open consideration that requires further assessment considering the requirements of both web visualization and analysis.


## Intermediary Vs Final

Final products are defined by biophysical variables whose values have a direct biological/ecological/analytical interest (ocean color products, Sea Surface Temperature, etc). On the contrary, intermediary products do not represent any direct biologically meaningful biophysical variable (e.g.: reflectance), but are essential to compute final products. Intermediary products would for instance not be made available to users or via ftp or visible on the web visualization platform.


## Product list

### Ocean color products

### Composite products and climatologies

Compositing times can be:

- Daily
- 8 days (45 composites per year + 5 days remainder on a non leap year)
- 16 days (22 composites per year + 13 days remainder on a non leap year)
- Monthly

These composites and the associated climatologies are only computed for the ocean color and temperature products defined in the previous section; not for reflectance data.


### Anomalies

Anomalies are derived in near real time by confronting newly acquired data to climatologies.
