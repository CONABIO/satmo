- Ask on forum whether files processed with `multilevel_processor.py` are definitive wrt ancillary data
- How to pass ancdir (`getanc.py`) to `multilevel-processor.py`
- TO avoid crashes when extracting (because of swath outside of extent), the extent of `query_from_extent` should be smaller than `extractJob.extract` extent.
- VIIRS:
    - l1aextract_viirs is not yet part of the `multilevel_processor.py`
    - GEO files (required for many things) can be downloaded from the oceancolor servers. TO be able to generate these files directly from L1A source files, a gigantic DEM is needed
- Lots of algorithms with formulas here http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/atbd
- VIIRS nc files have internal compression (I think)
- Handle sub files in download updating mode??
